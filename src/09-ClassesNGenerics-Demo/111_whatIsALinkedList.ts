// 111. What Is A Linked List?

/**
What is a linked list?
A linked list is a data structure consisting of a sequence of elements, where each element (node) contains a value and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. This allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements, as nodes can be added or removed without needing to shift other elements, unlike arrays. Linked lists can be singly linked (each node points to the next) or doubly linked (each node points to both the next and previous nodes). They are often used  in scenarios where dynamic memory allocation is required, such as implementing stacks, queues, and other data structures that require frequent modifications.
